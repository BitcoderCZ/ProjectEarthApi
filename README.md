*The core API for Project Earth*

## What does this component do?
The core API handles the bulk of game functionality - pretty much everything that isn't direct AR gameplay is done here.

## Prereqs:
 - .net 5 installed, and an IDE of your choice installed.
 - the configuration data from https://github.com/Project-Earth-Team/ApiData, or your own
## Building
 - Place the config in the same folder as whereever your built executable is going to end up
 - Open the sln in your IDE of choice
 - Build & run
